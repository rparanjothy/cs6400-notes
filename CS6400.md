Fundamentals of Databases

Extended Entity-Relationship Model
```

## Fundamentals of DB

- Fundamentals of databases
  - Examine or manage part of real world
  - model of reality
  - Model is a means of communication
  - Emphasis certail selected aspects
  - Described in some language
  - can be errors
  - may have features that does not exist in reality
- When to use a DB management system

  - Support data intensive apps (some are process intensive - compute)
  - persist storage
  - centralized control of data
  - control redundancy
  - control consistency and integrity
  - multi user support
  - Share data
  - data documentation
  - data independence - Change DB w/o impacting UI
  - access and security
  - backup and recovery

- WHEN NOT TO USE:

  - high initial investment, h/w, s/w, training is too high
  - generality is not needed - Eg. overhead of security concurrency, recovery
  - data is simple and stable
  - realtime requirements cannot be met
  - multi user access is not needed

- Outline of major topics

  - Data modeling
  - process modeling
  - database efficiency

- Data modeling
  - repr. perception of sturctures of reality
  - select and abstract
  - DML inside the program to interact with the db
  - DML directly on the db via adhoc query
  - DML -> SQL

Data model, DB architectures and DBMS Architecture

- Data Model

  - Data structures
  - Constraints
  - Operations
  - Keys and IDs
  - Integrity and consistency
  - null values
  - surrogates

- Data model is not the same as a MODEL of DATA!!
- Entity Relationship model
- Relational model
- hierarchial model
- no. of cols in a table is also called `degree` of the table
- schema stable over time; not expected to change; data is expected to change
- constraints express rules that cannot be expresssed by the data struct.
- `Operations` support change and retrieval of data
- `Keys` are uniqueness constraints
- Integrity and consistency; Inconsitency is bad data in relational tables
- Null values (unknowns)
- Surrogates - Things and names (names of things!)
  - name may change over time, Address may change over time
  - Name based reprn.
  - _surrogates are system generated unique internal identifiers_;_immutable_;_repr a real world entity_
- `Partial keys` - The partial Key of the weak entity set is also known as a discriminator

DB Architecture:

- ANSI/SPARC 3-level DB => External, Conceptual, and Internal

  - Schema / Data - we query against a schema which will being back results ie. data!!
  - Schema > internal Schema > Data
  - External schema <-> conceptual schema <->> Internal schema >> Data
  - Finally:

  ```
   External Schema (Use of data) (Views)
       |
   Conceptual Schema (MEaning of data) (Table)
       |
   Internal SChema (Storage of data) (Index)
       |
   Database
  ```

- Conceptual Schema

  - conceptually relevant , general and time-invariant structural aspects
  - This is what the user application sees. (The columns of a table )

- External Schema (SQL VIEWS)

  - this is virutal views, made up of the columns exposed in the conceptual schema

- Internal Schema (this is index)

  - desc. how the info in the conceptual schema is physically repr. to provide best perf.
  - Add an index to the freq. used and queried cols. `B+ Trees`

- Data independence:

  - Physical
    - line is between the conceptual layer and the physical - Index changes, OOPs reference.
  - Logical
    - Line betwn external and conceptual (View is impacted if table is changed)

- DB framwork

  - Schema compiler
  - Query transformer
  - Metadata database -> contains the info about external, conceptual, internal schemas (is inside Schema compiler layer)
  - User > Conceptual/External via an interface called SQL > Internal/Conceptual (What index to use)> Storage/internal (where is it stored)> Data (OS)

- Metadata is essential for making eveythin happen in a DB

- System metadata: Where is my data, how did it change, how is it stored, how is it mapped, who owns data, who can acess, usage history, stats
- Business metadata: where is it available, located, mean, access, predefined reports, queries, how current the data is

- System metadata -> DATABASE
- Business metadata -> Data warehouse

---

### Methodology

- Ellipse repr. task
- Block repr. interface/component/Document
- solid line - Information flow (not control flow)
- Dotted line - system boundary
- DONT connect Doc to Doc, Task to Task
- IFD - Info. flow diagram ; connected document/UI with task and DB

### Extended Entity relationship models

- Entity type - Time invarying - USER is an example; must be unique in the DB

  - Single value prop. (email, password)- lexical, visible, audible, things that name other things
  - Identifying prop; atmost one identified entity
  - Composite prop; made up of many - `Name >> First name + last name`
  - Multi value prop; `1:M` Eg. interests - Car, bus,etc; Repn. but double line
  - dotted line - partial identifier
  - `Derived` attr; computed value from attribute(s)

- Relationship type

  - 1:1; Partial functions because not all keys from tab1 may be mapped to tab2
  - 1:M; Partial function
  - Mandatory 1:1; all child table rows are mapped to a parent; but child less parent can exists; Total function
  - N:M; No function here just a relnship
  - **ATTN!! for 1:1 >> it's atmost 1.. meaning 0, 1**
  - **ATTN!! for 1:M >> it's atmost M.. meaning 0, 1 or more**
  - N-ary relation; (like binary.. N-ary) [User in a team (1:1) can participate in N events]

- Identifying relationships/weak entity types (`review section 3.5`)

  - diamonds with double lines
  - `OrderItem` has no meaning w/o an `Order`. hence Order `contains` OrderItems; This makes OrderItems a `weak entitiy`

- Recursive reln. type

  - maps to itself
  - employee, manager concept

- Supertypes and subtypes

  - `is-a` relationship type
  - `d` disjoint - user can't be male and female at the same time
  - `o` overlap - user can be regular and admin at the same time

- Supertypes and subtypes inheritance

  - Same as OOPS class inheritance

- Union Entity type

  - Mulitple inheritance, Company and Person can be the `Owner`

- Relationship are repn. by a diamond

  - relationship can have attributes

- What can the EER do? (abstraction)

  - Classifcation (Entity types)
  - Aggregation (Does not readily support!!)
  - Generalization (Super / Sub types)

- What is the result of a Query?
- Data model, constraints and ops.
- Properties are usually coming out a DB model
- Query language needs to be closed!!

All commercial DB products are relational!!

### Relational Databases

- Data Structures, constraints and operations
- Operations

  - Algebra
  - Calculus
    - Tuple calculus (SQL)
    - Domain calculus

- `Domain` D, is a set of atmoic values (Values w/o meaning) (a type)| `Table Column TYPE [VARCHAR, NUMERIC...]`
- `Reln.` R is a subset of the set of ordered n-tuples
- `attribute`, A is a unique name given to a domain in a relation helping us interpret domain values. | `Column NAME`
- `Degree` - number of columns in that table
- `Cardinality` - meaure of different values
- `Tuples` - Rows

- Constraints
  - Primary
  - Entity
  - Referential

### Methodology II - Specification

**Use attribute name**

- uniquely identified by email address
- valid email and password combination to log in
- Always use `names` from the document in the EER digram
- Model of reality, reality represented by the document(Requirement)
- subtypes of an type; `users and admin users`
- `must` mandatory relationship
- `either` disjoint (d) can't be both
- `unique` identifying attr
- `multi-value` 1:M ; Regular user : SchoolS; double line border
- `underlined property`: Primary key/uniquely identifies
- `dotted line property` Partial Identifier

### 7.EER Mapping

- Summarized the entire flow with disjoint, multiple values, 1:M, 1:1, N:M, primary keys, composite keys

### 8.Reading EER diagrams

- Represent EER in a text based description from the EER diagram

### 9. Data formats - beg, steal and borrow

- if someone has spent time and build something, why re-invent.. reuse.

### 10.Constraints

- `must be null`
- `until`
- `cannot be`
- `can only`
- Data format constraints.. MM-DD-YYYY
- constraints that can be expressed in the EER diag.

### 11. Task decomposition

- Single task vs decomposed
- Rules of Thumb:
  - Lookup vs insert/delete/update.. DDl vs DML - `different DB locks`
  - How many schema construct are involved? - `many DB locks`
  - Are enabling conditions consistent across tasks? - `scheduling`
  - Are frequecnies consistent across tasks? - `index only whats needed`
  - Is consistency essential? - `ACID`
  - Parent task control needed to control the child tasks - `driver/worker`

---

### 12. Webapps vs Traditional apps

Web:

- almost stateless; must have some state
- click stream history
- beginning to be more like traditional apps

Traditional-apps:

- easy to manage local state
- colelct all changes befor submitting to DB
- better support for ACID

### 13. Task decomposition hints.

- looks up needed (Read only)
- consistency needs (concurrent updates)
- task break up
- determine parent task
- determine order of execution
- determine list of values to show in drop downs
- determine frequency of the operation(s)
- determine schema involved
- Determine the sequence of operations in a task

### 14. Abstract code

- based on the mocks, arrive at a data/control flow > abstract pseudo code/flow
- no formal syntax
- `BOLD UNdERLINE` - Task defn.
- `BOLD` - Task call
- `Italics` - Button name

```

- EER diagrams to relations
- Entity type, create a relation; they have same name.
- Primary key will have an underscore
- Composite type C, gets lost. `Fname, Lname`.. there will be no `name`

  > Relation is a subset of tuples that were constructured from domains with atomic values.

- Multivalue attributes

  - Name of the entity type (ET) and the name of the multiple attribute
  - `Employee-Projects` as example; ends up being a combination becomes a key

- Foreign key references

>

- ET
- ET-A-F
- ET1-A-ET2

- ET1-R-A-ET2
- ET-B-ET1-ET2 (Union)

### Case1: Mandatory/disjoing

- Disjoint, will not have the parent entity ; bc its either or.

### Case2: Mandatory/overlap

- Overlap, will have the parent entity; bc its A, b or both.

### Case3: Non mandatory/overlap

- The PK of the parent entity will be used in the child.
- Cross ref table. holds A and B info to connect ET1 and ET2

### Case4: Non mandatory/disjoint

- ET parent exists as a table
- ET1 and ET2 inherits the PK of ET
- ET1 and ET2 will have their own attributes

## Relational algebra and Calculus

- Closed Algebra: BODMAS
- Relational Algebra operators

  - Union {U}
  - Intesection {n}
  - set difference {\\}
  - Cartesian product {x}

  - Projetion (Pi) - Eliminating columns [SELECT]
  - Selection (Sigma) - Eliminating rows [WHERE]

  - natural join {\*}
  - outer join
  - theta join

  - divideby
  - rename

- Sigma column=value (Tablename)
- Composite expression

  - AND : COnjunction ^
  - OR : Disjunction V

- relations are sets (DISTINCT) NO duplicates!!

- union: u

  - eg: what cities are users currentCity or homeTown
  - Types matter..! compatible

- Intersection: n

  - eg: all cities that are currentCity and a home town

- Set Difference: \

  - eg: currentCity for some, but exclude those that are hometown for some users

- Natural join (Equi-join)
  - > Starts joining based on the column names that are same on joined entities.
- Theta join (Non Equi-join)
- Left outer join (Preserve regular user data even if they dont match an event)
- Cartesian product
  - cartesian product with set difference can help you find, the user interests that a user is not registered
- Divide by: eg.. find emails of all users with atleast the interests of user1
  - Not readily supported in SQL
  - output always includes user1 because user1 matches user1
- Rename

## Projection

- This is select cols
- Find email, birthyear and sex for regularusers with hometown Austin
  > {r.email, r.birthyear, r.sex }|r E RegularUser and r.hometown=="Austin"}

## Union

# Chapter 5 Summary:

## The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints

## Modeling Concepts

- Introduced concepts of domains, attributes, and tuples.
- Defined a relation schema as a list of attributes describing the structure of a relation.
- A relation (or relation state) is a set of tuples conforming to the schema.

## Characteristics of Relations

- Not sensitive to the ordering of tuples.
- Discussed ordering of attributes and tuple values within a relation schema.

## Values in Tuples

- Introduced NULL values to represent missing or unknown information.
- Emphasized the avoidance of NULL values whenever possible.

## Database Constraints

- Classified constraints into inherent model-based, explicit schema-based, and semantic/business rule constraints.

### Relational Model Constraints

1. Domain constraints
2. Key constraints (superkey, key, primary key)
3. NOT NULL constraint on attributes

### Additional Relational Constraints

- Entity integrity constraint (prohibits NULL in primary key attributes).
- Referential integrity constraint (maintains consistency of references among tuples from various relations).

## Modification Operations

- Insert, Delete, and Update operations discussed.
- Each operation may violate certain constraints.
- Resulting database state must always be valid.

# Insert Operation in Relational Databases

The **Insert operation** involves providing a list of attribute values for a new tuple, denoted as "t," to be added to a relation "R." However, Insert can potentially violate four types of constraints:

1. **Domain Constraints:**

   - Violation occurs if an attribute value provided is not in the corresponding domain or is of an inappropriate data type.

2. **Key Constraints:**

   - Violation happens if a key value in the new tuple "t" already exists in another tuple within the relation "r(R)."

3. **Entity Integrity:**

   - Can be violated if any part of the primary key in the new tuple "t" is NULL.

4. **Referential Integrity:**
   - Violation occurs if the value of any foreign key in "t" refers to a tuple that does not exist in the referenced relation.

These constraints highlight potential issues that need to be considered and managed when performing the Insert operation in relational databases.

# Delete Operation in Relational Databases

The **Delete operation** has a specific constraint it can potentially violate:

- **Referential Integrity:**
  - Violation happens if the tuple being deleted is referenced by foreign keys from other tuples in the database.

To perform a deletion, a condition based on the attributes of the relation is specified, selecting the tuple (or tuples) to be deleted. This constraint emphasizes the need to manage references to the tuple being deleted to maintain the integrity of the relational database.

## Transaction Concept

- Introduced the concept of a transaction.
- Important in relational DBMSs for grouping multiple database operations into a single atomic action.

# 5.3.4 The Transaction Concept

In a relational database, a database application program commonly performs one or more transactions. Here's what a transaction is:

- **Transaction Definition:**

  - An executing program involving database operations like reading from the database or applying insertions, deletions, or updates.
  - Multiple retrieval and update operations within a transaction form an atomic unit of work against the database.

- **Transaction Completion:**

  - At the end of a transaction, the database must be left in a valid and consistent state, satisfying all specified constraints on the database schema.

- **Example Transaction:**

  - For instance, a transaction for a bank withdrawal involves reading the user account record, checking for sufficient balance, and updating the record with the withdrawal amount.

- **Transaction Volume:**

  - Commercial applications in online transaction processing (OLTP) systems often handle several hundred transactions per second.

- **Upcoming Topics:**
  - Concepts such as concurrent execution of transactions and recovery from failures will be discussed in Chapters 20 to 22.

## Chapter 8

## Introduction

In this chapter, two formal languages for the relational model are presented, aiming to manipulate relations and produce new relations as query answers. The discussion covers the relational algebra and its operations, specifying a sequence of operations for queries. Additionally, two types of relational calculi, tuple calculus, and domain calculus are introduced.

## Basic Relational Algebra Operations

Sections 8.1 through 8.3 delve into basic relational algebra operations:

- Unary operators: `SELECT`, `PROJECT`, `RENAME`.
- Binary set theoretic operations: `UNION`, `INTERSECTION`, `SET DIFFERENCE`.
- Explanation of the rarely used `CARTESIAN PRODUCT`, leading to JOIN operations (`THETA JOIN`, `EQUIJOIN`, `NATURAL JOIN`).
- Introduction of query trees as a graphical representation of relational algebra queries.

> Degree in `PROJECTION` is equal to the number of attributes in the attribute list/columns in the table

> The number of tuples in a relation resulting from a PROJECT operation is always less than or equal to the number of tuples in R

## Advanced Relational Algebra Concepts

- Introduction of `GENERALIZED PROJECTION` for functions in projection lists and `AGGREGATE FUNCTION` for statistical requests.
- Handling of recursive queries in a step-by-step approach.
- `OUTER JOIN` and `OUTER UNION` operations for preserving all information in source relations.

## Relational Calculus

- Based on predicate calculus in mathematical logic.
- Two types: `tuple relational calculus` (using tuple variables) and `domain relational calculus` (using domain variables).
- Declarative nature with no specified retrieval order, considered higher-level than relational algebra.
- Introduction of query graphs as an internal representation.
- Discussion of existential (`∃`) and universal (`∀`) quantifiers, and transformation rules.
- Expressive power of relational calculus through quantifiers, equivalent to basic relational algebra.
- Lack of grouping and aggregation functions, with some suggested extensions.

# Chapter 9:

# Section 9.1: Mapping ER Model to Relational Database Schema

- Demonstrated how a conceptual schema design in the ER model can be translated into a relational database schema.
- Provided an algorithm for ER-to-relational mapping.
- Illustrated the mapping process with examples from the COMPANY database.
- Table 9.1 summarized correspondences between ER and relational model constructs and constraints.

# Section 9.2: Enhancements for EER Model Mapping

- Extended the algorithm from Section 9.1 to include additional steps for mapping constructs from the Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) model to the relational model.
- EER model enhancements contribute to richer conceptual modeling.
- Mentioned the incorporation of similar algorithms into graphical database design tools.
- These tools automate the creation of a relational schema from a conceptual schema design.

# Overall Summary

- The sections highlight the process of transforming both ER and EER conceptual schema designs into corresponding relational database schemas.
- Algorithms provided facilitate the mapping, and graphical database design tools often automate this conversion process.
