## Fundamentals of DB

- Fundamentals of databases
  - Examine or manage part of real world
  - model of reality
  - Model is a means of communication
  - Emphasis certail selected aspects
  - Described in some language
  - can be errors
  - may have features that does not exist in reality
- When to use a DB management system

  - Support data intensice apps (some are process intensive - compute)
  - persist storage
  - centralized control of data
  - control redundancy
  - control consistency and integrity
  - multi user support
  - Share data
  - data documentation
  - data independence - Change DB w/o impacting UI
  - access and security
  - backup and recovery

- WHEN NOT TO USE:

  - high initial investment, h/w, s/w, training is too high
  - generality is not needed - Eg. overhead of security concurrency, recovery
  - data is simple and stable
  - realtime reqa cannot be met
  - multu user access is not needed

- Outline of major topics

  - Data modeling
  - process modeling
  - database efficiency

- Data modeling
  repr. perception of sturctures of reality
  select and abstract
  DML inside the program to interact with the db
  DML directly on the db via adhoc query
  DML -> SQL

Data model, DB architectures and DBMS Architecture

- Data Model

  - Data structures
  - Constraints
  - Operations
  - Keys and IDs
  - Integrity and consistency
  - null values
  - surrogates

- Data model is not the same as a MODEL of DATA!!
- Entity Relationship model
- Relational model
- hierarchial model
- no. of cols in a table is also called `degree` of the table
- schema stable over time; not expected to change; data is expected to change
- constraints express rules that cannot be expresssed by the data struct.
- `Operations` support change and retrieval of data
- `Keys` are uniqueness constraints
- Integrity and consistency; Inconsitency is bad data in relational tables
- Null values (unknowns)
- Surrogates - Things and names (names of things!)
  - name may change over time, Address may change over time
  - Name based reprn.
  - _surrogates are system generated unique internal identifiers_;_immutable_;_repr a real world entity_

DB Architecture:

- ANSI/SPARC 3-level DB => External, Conceptual, and Internal

  - Schema / Data - we query against a schema which will being back results ie. data!!
  - Schema > internal Schema > Data
  - External schema <-> conceptual schema <->> Internal schema >> Data
  - Finally:

  ```
    External Schema (Use of data) (Views)
       |
   Conceptual Schema (MEaning of data) (Table)
       |
   Internal SChema (Storage of data) (Index)
       |
   Database
  ```

- Conceptual Schema

  - conceptually relevant , general and time-invariant structural aspects
  - This is what the user application sees. (The columns of a table )

- External Schema (SQL VIEWS)

  - this is virutal views, made up of the columns exposed int he conceptual schema

- Internal Schema (this is index)

  - desc. how the info in the conceptual schema is physically repr. to provide best perf.
  - Add an index to the freq. used and queried cols. `B+ Trees`

- Data independence:

  - Physical
    - line is between the conceptual layer and the physical - Index changes, OOPs reference.
  - Logical
    - Line betwn external and conceptual (View is impacted if table is changed)

- DB framwork

  - Schema compiler
  - Query transformer
  - Metadata database -> contains the info about external, conceptual, internal schemas (is inside Schema compiler layer)
  - User > Conceptual/External via an interface called SQL > Internal/Conceptual (What index to use)> Storage/internal (where is it stored)> Data (OS)

- Metadata is essential for making eveythin happen in a DB

- System metadata: Where is my data, how did it change, how is it stored, how is it mapped, who owns data, who can acess, usage history, stats
- Business metadata: where is it available, located, mean, access, predefined reports, queries, how current the data is

- System metadata -> DATABASE
- Business metadata -> Data warehouse

### Methodology

- Ellipse repr. task
- Block repr. interface/component/Document
- solid line - Information flow (not control flow)
- Dotted line - system boundary
- DONT connect Doc to Doc, Task to Task
- IFD - Info. flow diagram ; connected document/UI with task and DB

### Extended Entity relationship models

- Entity type - Time invarying - USER is an example; must be unique in the DB
- Single value prop. (email, password)- lexical, visible, audible, things that name other things
- Identifying prop; atmost one identified entity
- Composite prop; made up of many - `Name >> First name + last name`
- Multi value prop; `1:M` Eg. interests - Car, bus,etc; Repn. but double line
